===================

This is my attempt at building a site from scratch. My usual go was to find a template and deconstruct it. I guess I'm taking up a new lease. 

My process for building was simply. Draw how I wanted it to look on my whiteboard and went from there. If there came an instance where I wanted to add something but didn't know how I simply googled it. Mind you, I DID NOT follow best practices, used correct naming conventions, etc. There are instances where I gave h1's and ID to make changes. But I was just having fun. Welcome To My Playground, enjoy.

			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<p>about this site.</p>
			<p>2/21/15</p>
			<p>first off, i am a big lover and anime and cartoons. my favorites being <em>The Boondocks (2005)</em> and <em>Samurai Champloo</em>. youll notice throughout your exploration of the site. my main style of contstructing a site has mostly been to find a good template and deconstruct it as much as possible. this is my attempt at a site built totally from scratch. i drew how i wanted it to look and i built it. and if there is something i don't know or need to know how to do i simply refer back to my html&amp;css book, w3schools, or google. enjoy your stay. <br /><br/>welcome to my playground.</p>
